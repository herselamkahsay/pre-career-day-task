# pre-career-day-task
# the first thing what i did 
is to understand very well the assignment
chosing which method i will use(Teck stack)
understanding API since its my first time to use
rougnly sketch up my desing on paper
start to code using html and css
then later javascript which is difficult for me to make it interactif and access the API
i choose this teck stack because i am familar with 
it was better and easy way to use libraries or framworks but i didn't
